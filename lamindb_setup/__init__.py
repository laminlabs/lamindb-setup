"""Setup & configure LaminDB.

Every function in the API has a matching command in the `lamin` CLI.

Typically, you'll want to use the CLI rather than this API.

Guide: :doc:`docs:setup`.

Setup:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree:

   login
   logout
   init
   load
   close
   delete

More instance operations:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree:

   migrate
   register

Modules & settings:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree:

   settings
   core
   django
