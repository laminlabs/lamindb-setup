    Creates a SQLite database with the same schema as the source Postgres instance.
    The copy shares the same storage location as the original instance.

    The copy is intended for read-only access to instance data without requiring a Postgres connection.
    Data synchronization to complete the clone happens via a separate Lambda function.

    Note that essential user, branch and storage tables are missing.
    Therefore, it is not possible to store Artifacts without having replayed these records first.

            If `None`, looks for an environment variable `LAMIN_CURRENT_INSTANCE` to get the instance identifier.
            If it doesn't find this variable, it connects to the instance that was connected with `lamin connect` through the CLI.
